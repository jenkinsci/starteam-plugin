		If the label contains %{&lt;format&gt;:BUILD_NUMBER} the label will be interpreted as a format string for a build
    label which will be created on the StarTeam server and then checked out. For example, label "build.%{d:BUILD_NUMBER}"

    <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html">Java format string</a>. Other examples:
    <ul>
    <li>jenkins-%{x:BUILD_NUMBER} &rarr; jenkins-2a</li>
    <li>jenkins-%{04d:BUILD_NUMBER} &rarr; jenkins-0042</li>
    </ul>
